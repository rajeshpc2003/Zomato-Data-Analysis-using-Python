# Zomato Data Analysis using Python
This project performs data analysis on Zomato restaurant data to extract meaningful insights about restaurant trends, ratings, cuisines, and locations.
<br>
It demonstrates the use of Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, processing, and visualization.
<br>
<br>
**Project Overview**
<br>
The goal of this project is to analyze Zomato's dataset to answer questions like:
<br>
-- Which countries have the highest number of restaurants listed?
<br>
-- What are the most popular cuisines and price ranges?
<br>
-- How do ratings vary across countries or cuisines?
<br>
-- What factors influence restaurant ratings?
<br>
<br>
This project is inspired by the tutorial from (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science/zomato-data-analysis-using-python" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks</a>).
